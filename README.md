# Employee Payroll Management System (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Employee Payroll Management System is a console-based Java application designed to manage employee records and automate salary calculations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This project demonstrates core Java concepts such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Collections, and File Handling.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add Permanent and Contract Employees
- Calculate Net Salary using Polymorphism
- Store employee records persistently using File Handling
- Display all employee details
- Menu-driven console interface
- Clean and scalable OOP architecture

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation** – Employee data is protected using access modifiers
- **Abstraction** – Payroll rules are defined using abstract classes
- **Inheritance** – Permanent and Contract employees extend a base employee class
- **Polymorphism** – Salary calculation logic is decided at runtime
- **Collections** – ArrayList is used to store employee records
- **File Handling** – Employee data is saved and loaded from a file

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17+)
- VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse
- File Handling (No Database – Internship-level project)
